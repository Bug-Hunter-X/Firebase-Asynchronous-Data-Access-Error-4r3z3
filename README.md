This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before it's fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code that accesses snapshot data prematurely within an asynchronous callback. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, using `.then()` or async/await to ensure the data is loaded before accessing it. The root cause is the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations; data retrieval isn't immediate. This example helps understand how to correctly handle asynchronous operations in Firebase to prevent data access errors.
