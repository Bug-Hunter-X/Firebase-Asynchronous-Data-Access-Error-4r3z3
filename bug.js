The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This is particularly common when dealing with asynchronous operations. For example, if you try to access the data from a document snapshot inside a callback function before the `onSnapshot` listener has completed, you'll get an error. This error might manifest differently based on the type of data you're accessing and the specific Firebase product involved.
